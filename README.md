## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React for interactivity
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

### What I Learned

This project was my first experience using React, where I learned how to utilize React hooks such as `useState` and gained an understanding of how components work together to build dynamic user interfaces.

### Continued Development

I see React as a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications. Moving forward, I intend to deepen my understanding of React by exploring more advanced topics and best practices. I aim to leverage React's capabilities to create engaging user experiences and enhance my skills as a frontend developer.
